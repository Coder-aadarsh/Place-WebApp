# Place-WebApp
M.E.R.N full stack Place App, with users and places
The application is a fullstack web application built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The purpose of this application is to provide a practical and comprehensive example of how these technologies can be integrated to develop a complete and functional project. Let's delve into the details of the intended application:
Application Overview:
1.	User Authentication and Authorization: The application is likely to have user authentication and authorization features. Users would be able to create accounts (signup) and log in securely. User authorization would control access to different parts of the application based on user roles.
2.	File Upload Functionality: The application will include the capability to upload files, particularly images. Both the frontend and backend components are required for handling file uploads.
3.	Frontend and Backend Integration: The application will showcase the integration between the frontend, built with React.js, and the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js. This integration would demonstrate how data flows between the two parts of the application.
4.	Database Interaction: MongoDB will be used as the database for the application.
5.	Database - perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and manage data.
