# Place-WebApp

## Overview

Place-WebApp is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. The primary purpose of this application is to provide a practical and comprehensive example of how these technologies can be integrated to develop a complete and functional project. This README.md file serves as the documentation for the Place-WebApp project.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts (signup) and securely log in.
- User Authorization: Different parts of the application are accessible based on user roles.

### File Upload Functionality

- Users can upload files, particularly images.
- Both the frontend and backend components are set up to handle file uploads.

### Frontend and Backend Integration

- The application demonstrates the integration between the frontend, built with React.js, and the backend, powered by Node.js and Express.js.
- Data flow between the frontend and backend is showcased.

### Database Interaction

- MongoDB is used as the database for the application.
- Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js and npm installed locally. You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible via a remote server.
- Git installed on your local machine.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Place-WebApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Place-WebApp
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies
   cd frontend
   npm install

   # Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies
   cd ../backend
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

### Backend Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and configure the following environment variables:

   ```env
   PORT=3001
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-connection-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-connection-uri` with the MongoDB connection URI, and `your-secret-key` with a secure JWT secret key.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the backend directory
   cd backend

   # Start the server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
   # Navigate to the frontend directory
   cd frontend

   # Start the development server
   npm start
